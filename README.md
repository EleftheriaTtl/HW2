# HW2
The repository contains 2 files:
## main.ipynb
This jupyter files contain 6 functions, one for each of the RQ tasks. The functions take as input the path of the dataset to analyse and return what the question is asking. It can take dataset from different leagues.
The 6 functions are called separately with the Premier League dataset as default.
The 2 CRQ exercises need just to be run in their block and will give the expected result.

## theory.ipynb
This jupyter markdown file contains the answer to the theoretical question. It reports the two pices of code to analyse.
